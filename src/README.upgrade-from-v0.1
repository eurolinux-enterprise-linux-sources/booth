Notes on upgrade from PAXOS booth v0.1
======================

Booth v0.1 was a booth version based on the PAXOS algorithm. The
current booth v0.2 is loosely based on raft and incompatible
with the one running v0.1. Therefore, rolling upgrades are not
possible.

Due to the new multi-tenancy feature, the new arbitrator init
script cannot stop or test status of the paxos v0.1 arbitrator.
On upgrade to v0.2, the arbitrator, if running, will be stopped.

The OCF resource-agent ocf:pacemaker:booth-site is capable of
stopping and monitoring the booth v0.1 site daemon.

Update procedure
----------------

The recommended procedure for update from the paxos booth to the
new booth version is as follows:

- convert the configuration file /etc/booth/booth.conf on all
  nodes and arbitrators to the new syntax

- update booth on all arbitrators and start them

- update booth on all nodes and restart the resource:

	# crm resource restart booth

Configuration file syntax changes
----------------

.Note
If you didn't specify expiry time or weights different from the
defaults, then you can skip this section and use the old
'booth.conf'.

The new booth configuration has many more options for tickets
and the syntax for 'ticket' got changed. Whereas previously the
optional expiry time and weights could be specified by appending
them to the ticket name with a ';' as a separator, the new syntax
has separate tokens for all ticket options.

For instance, this ticket specification:

	ticket="tkt-A;600;1,2,2"

looks in the new syntax like this:

	ticket="tkt-A"
		expire="600"
		weights="1,2,2"

See the 'booth(8)' man page for more details.
